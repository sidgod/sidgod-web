## About Me
Hello, I'm [Siddharth Godbole](#). I live in Pune, India with my family. I started my programming stint with C language, followed by use of Java, C++ and most recently - Go. I've been working for more than 10 years as a professional software engineer now and I'm trying to pivot and get some exposure to ML these days.

I have been swimming my entire life, mainly to cool my boots! ;)

I am passionate about writing awesome software to help our future generations do more meaningful things (than just coding, duh!)!!!.

I am working with [Symantec Corporation](http://www.symantec.com) for ~6 years, so far its been really fun!
