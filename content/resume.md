## Resume
I've been working for more than 10 years now and here are some highlights of my career:
## Work Experience
I've been working for Symantec for more than 5 years now, in this tenure I've worked as individual contributor (IC) as well as lead a team of upto 5 people. In this period, I got chance to work on most amazing people. Some of the projects that I have participated in major way are:
#### Migration to AWS
I am part of team that has to move from Legacy datacenter to AWS. As part of program to gain knowledge and insights into AWS, I got a chance to attend [AWS re:Invent 2016]. Over time I have become go-to guy for AWS architecture and patterns.
#### Monitoring
One of the most important parts of building a software that works with hundreds of TBs of data daily is to be able to monitor it end-to-end. I lead a team of engineers to create a mechanism to do just that - *Monitor, Visualize and Alert*
#### Log Collection Appliance
I worked extensively on building multiple generations of on-premise Log Collection Appliance. All such appliances today generate multiple hundred TBs of data globally. I lead designs for high performance, low latency, highly re-usable on-premise data processing pipeline with excellent monitoring capabilities.

Lead one release end-to-end, was handling a team of 4-5 developers. Had been involved with product performance improvement cycles both on backend (database) as well as application layer. Was involved in next-gen product line PoCs to device upon use of upcoming techs for current product. Was owner of entired neetwork based adapter stack consisting of atleast 12 network protocols. Was part of product expert group to respond to solutions delivery concerns. Has ownership of about 10+ components.
